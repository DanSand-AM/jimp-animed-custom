title: Migrating to v1
description: How to migrate from v0 to v1
---

The goals of v1 were to:

1. Make jimp easier to use in any environment
2. Make jimp's API more consistent and easier to use

## Positional Arguments to Options Objects 

In jimp v0 there were many ways to provide arguments to a method. 
Most methods used positional arguments, which leads to code thats harder to read and extend.

For example the resize method used to look like this:

```js
image.resize(100, 100);
```

Now it looks like this:

```js
image.resize({ w: 100, h: 100 });
```

### `ResizeStrategy.AUTO`

This constant was only needed for positional arguments.
It is no longer needed with the new API.

## `Jimp` Constructor

The constructor for `Jimp` has changed.
Much in the same vein as above, the constructor now takes an options object.

To create and empty jimp image:

```js
import { Jimp } from "jimp";

const image = new Jimp({ width: 100, height: 100 });
```

Even give it a background color:

```js
const image = new Jimp({ width: 100, height: 100, color: 0xff0000ff }); 
```

### `Jimp.read`

In v0 of jimp the constructor was async!
This is a huge anit-pattern so it had to go.

Now you should instead use the `Jimp.read` method.

In node environments it will read a file from disk.

```js
import { Jimp } from "jimp";

async function main() {
  const image = await Jimp.read("test/image.png");
}
```

In the browser it fetch the file from the url.

```js
import { Jimp } from "jimp";

async function main() {
  const image = await Jimp.read("https://example.com/image.png");
}
```

### `Jimp.fromBuffer`

You can load an image from a buffer.
In v0 this was done through the constructor.
In v1 it is done through the `Jimp.fromBuffer` method.

```js
import { Jimp } from "jimp";

async function main() {
  const image = await Jimp.fromBuffer(buffer);
}
```

### `Jimp.fromBitmap`

You can load an image from a bitmap.
In v0 this was done through the constructor.
In v1 it is done through the `Jimp.fromBitmap` method.

```js
import { Jimp } from "jimp";

async function main() {
  const image = await Jimp.fromBitmap(bitmap);
}
```
